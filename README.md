# gold-prediction

This repository contains all the code used for my EECE 5644 project. File names are descriptive of what they are intended to do. Keep in mind that a lot of changes were made as strategies were altered, so different lines may be commented out that perform different actions.

Various different methods were used to try and predict the next day's gold price based on the previous n days. Data from the CBOE volatility index was added for improved returns. View the presentation here: https://youtu.be/sVifH65XaNw?si=ANdtqgQy5hjvczzN
